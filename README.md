# Routine It
Routine It is a web app that helps you create and maintain different versions of a daily routine.

## Insipiration
A neurodivergent youtuber named Haley Honeyman devised a method to organized her mornings and stick to a routine called the [Honeyman method](https://youtu.be/JQFZNQS6eQ0?si=k0zWNBbNA2oAt4at).

For neurodivergent induviduals, partically those who are comorbid with both ADHD and Autism, sticking to a routine can be crucial to quality of life but difficult to keep up with. Autism is a condition that craves and thrives with a routine but ADHD can interfere with continually keeping up with a routine for more than a few days.

The Honeyman method removes the burden of always having to achieve 100% of the items in the morning routine by creating teirs that correspond with how much energy you wake up with, partically to satisfy the ADHD brain. 


Example from video: 

| High Energy Day | Average Day | Low Energy Day |
|--- | --- | --- |
| Wake up | Wake up| Wake Up |
| Bathrom | Bathroom | Bathroom |
| Walk Dog (45 min - 1 hour) | Walk Dog (20 - 30 min)| Walk Dog( 10 minutes, or outside time) |
| High Quality Breakfast | Medium Quality Breakfast | Low Effort Breakfast |
| Get ready (look hot)| Get ready (look good, less effort) | Get ready (minimal effort)|
| Journal |  |  |
| Make To Do List |  |  |
| Check Emails |  |  |

You can learn more about the Honeyman method from [Haley's youtube video](https://youtu.be/JQFZNQS6eQ0?si=k0zWNBbNA2oAt4at).

## Goals and Objectives

### The Problem with Routines for Me ü´§

As someone comorbid with ADHD and Autism, I've never been able to keep a routine despite desperately needing one. I have a pattern. I see some motivational video or social media post about getting into a routine and getting my life on track. I've got boundless levels of energy and my meter is full. I think of one routine with a laundry list of tasks to do every single morning. I make it through the list for one day, two if I'm lucky. And then on the third day, I wake up with 50% energy in my meter. I maybe complete a few items, but I feel discouraged because I can't live up to my own expectaions that I set when I had 100% energy. I'm dissapointed in myself that I messed up so quick, and I abandon my list altogether. 

I've lived this cycle so many times, I ditched routines all together. I leaned on chaos and lack of structure, taking one day at a time. But I started feeling frustrated with that too. I lost velocity in my life, shifting wherever the wind (AKA my ADHD brain) takes every single day. Some things would go forgotten and get swept under the rug. My constant need for adjustment demolished my sense of direction. My autistic brain, who needs a clear path forward to acheive even the littlest of feats was lost.

When you get lost, a compass can help guide you back to a path home (or maybe more realistically Google Maps in this day and age). I reccently found my compass on YouTube, from a video titled [Routines for ADHD that ACTUALLY WORK! üåõ‚òÄÔ∏è (Morning/Night routines)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQFZNQS6eQ0&ab_channel=HayleyHoneyman). In this video, a girl named Haley who has an [AuDHD neurotype](https://www.neurodiversecouplescounseling.com/audhd) like myself, explains her personal system (The Honeyman Method) for creating a routine that caters to both the variablilty of your energy when you have ADHD, and the need for structure when you have Autism. The system creates three tiers of your routine in order to allow yourself the grace to not stick to your most perfect ideal routine by having additional 2 scaled back routines for when you have an average energy day and a low energy day. I absolutely loved this idea and wanted to try it out thus Routine It was born, in order to organize and craft these routines.

My vision for Routine It is to create an easy to use interface to allow myself and others to create tiered routine systems that work for them. Too many things in this world are made without neurodiverse people in mind. It's time for a routine planner for us by us.

### Who is This App Made For? üëØ

This app is design specifically for those with neurotypes, mental conditions, or other difficulties that get in the way of keeping and maintianing a routine. Some of us just need a little assistance in creating a highly flexible yet structured routine that can allow us to have good days and bad days and not fall out of our routine.

However anyone who benefits from this design is allowed to use it!

### Objectives
1. Provide a user-friendly webapp implementation of the Honeyman method.
2. Improve routine adherence and wellbeing for neurodivergent induviduals.
3. Mainatian and engage a user base.

### Successs Metrics
1. Have 80% adherence to routines across all users.
2. Have at least on user engaged for 30 days adherring to thier routine.

### Key Features
1. Secure authentication and private personalized routines
2. Survey to create 3 tiered routine
3. Notification reminders
4. Checkable lists
5. Dashboard for routine adherance analytics

### Ethical and Inclusive Desgin
1. Ensure privacy and securtiy for all users
2. Accessibility features to accomodate differing ability sets
3. Feedback from neurodiverse users to address needs and preferences

### Routine It and My Goals
Since I learend to code at such a young age, I always knew I could have an impact on the world. The phrase "I will change the world through code" has echoed in my brain for years. Statring this project of Routine It, I can change the world, to design something that is inclusive, user-centric, and sees a group of people who have been unseen for centuries. The world has failed time after time to give neurodivergent people the tools to keep up with neurotypicals. I want neurodivergent people to have a better life and a fighting chance to get to where we want to go. I'm listening to Ghandi and I'm going be the change I wish to see in the world.
