## Insipiration
A neurodivergent youtuber named Haley Honeyman devised a method to organized her mornings and stick to a routine called the [Honeyman method](https://youtu.be/JQFZNQS6eQ0?si=k0zWNBbNA2oAt4at).

For neurodivergent induviduals, partically those who are comorbid with both ADHD and Autism, sticking to a routine can be crucial to quality of life but difficult to keep up with. Autism is a condition that craves and thrives with a routine but ADHD can interfere with continually keeping up with a routine for more than a few days.

The Honeyman method removes the burden of always having to achieve 100% of the items in the morning routine by creating teirs that correspond with how much energy you wake up with, partically to satisfy the ADHD brain. 


Example from video: 

| High Energy Day | Average Day | Low Energy Day |
|--- | --- | --- |
| Wake up | Wake up| Wake Up |
| Bathrom | Bathroom | Bathroom |
| Walk Dog (45 min - 1 hour) | Walk Dog (20 - 30 min)| Walk Dog( 10 minutes, or outside time) |
| High Quality Breakfast | Medium Quality Breakfast | Low Effort Breakfast |
| Get ready (look hot)| Get ready (look good, less effort) | Get ready (minimal effort)|
| Journal |  |  |
| Make To Do List |  |  |
